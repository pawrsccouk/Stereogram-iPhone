# Stereogram-iPhone
An iPhone app designed to help the user take photos to be turned into stereograms.

This application presents the user with a modified camera view including a crosshair.
The user is prompted to centre the crosshair on a prominent landmark and then take one picture.
The user is then prompted to take a pace to the right, keeping the crosshair on the landmark,
and then take a second picture.

The two pictures are then composited into a stereogram and the user can examine the image
and switch between cross-eyed and wall-eyed viewing modes. 

The stereogram is then stored and the user can review them and transfer the final image to the Camera Roll if so wished.
